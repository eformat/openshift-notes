sidecar memory

(50-200MB/sidecar - 100GB of RAM reserved _per node_ for 500 pods)

istio 1.4

- The Envoy proxy uses 0.5 vCPU and 50 MB memory per 1000 requests per second going through the proxy.
- The istio-telemetry service uses 0.6 vCPU per 1000 mesh-wide requests per second.
- Pilot uses 1 vCPU and 1.5 GB of memory.
- The Envoy proxy adds 6.3 ms to the 90th percentile latency.

Istio CNI

The Istio CNI plugin replaces proxy-init on OpenShift 4 clusters. Using CNI eliminates the need for the `NET_ADMIN` privilege on application containers. The Istio CNI plugin is enabled through Multus CNI. The Istio operator creates a `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` object in each project that is part of the mesh. This object is referenced in the k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks annotation, which is added to a pod during injection.

#### Service mesh project isolation

- delegate the management of the mesh control plane to the tenants
- which were already aggregated in groups of apps that made sense to run in the same mesh
- generic mesh which is secure by default rather than open giving users the ability to develop and test their service mesh apps and to be unaware of what other projects are in the mesh

#### add option to not allow traffic from the router in a tenant namespace

Currently the network policy created by maistra allow traffic from the router in a tenant namespace as long as a pod as a specific annotation.

The RFE is to provide an option in the servicemesh control plane to disable that.

#### Create ServiceMeshGateway resource issue

upstream Istio created this issue to track it: <https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MAISTRA-1874>

`ServiceMeshGateway` resource should be used to allow users to create a gateway in any project in the mesh

#### Multi Cluster

multi-cluster Service Mesh with a centralized istiod control plane(Istiod) (experimental)

#### mTLS
